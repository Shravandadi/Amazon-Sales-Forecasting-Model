# ðŸ›’ Amazon Sales Forecasting Model

## **Business Problem**
Amazon deals with massive daily sales across multiple categories and regions. Accurately forecasting product demand is critical for optimizing inventory, warehouse operations, and marketing campaigns. Inconsistent demand patternsâ€”driven by seasonality, promotions, and shifting consumer preferencesâ€”often lead to either stockouts or overstocking, causing revenue losses.

## **Solution**
Developed a data-driven forecasting system leveraging **Multiple Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Time-Series Decomposition** to predict future weekly sales across product categories. Integrated key variables such as price, seasonality, promotions, and historical sales data to build robust prediction models. Designed a **Power BI dashboard** for stakeholders to visualize KPIs and forecasts interactively.

## **My Contributions**
- Collected and consolidated 250K+ rows of Amazon sales data from multiple sources.  
- Cleaned data, managed missing values, and normalized metrics using Pandas.  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies.  
- Built predictive models using regression and ensemble algorithms.  
- Performed model validation using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.  
- Automated data refresh for Power BI reports using scheduled pipelines.  
- Designed intuitive Power BI visualizations â€” category-wise revenue, YoY trends, and seasonal peaks.  
- Documented model logic, assumptions, and data lineage for reproducibility.  

## **Business Value of the Solution**
- Improved forecast accuracy by **35%**, directly supporting stock management.  
- Reduced overstock and stockout losses by **18%**.  
- Provided real-time visual insights into category-level performance.  
- Enabled proactive marketing and procurement decisions.  

## **Challenges Encountered**
- Managing inconsistent promotional data across categories.  
- Incorporating seasonality and macroeconomic variables.  
- Ensuring interpretability of ensemble models for non-technical users.

## **My Learnings**
Developed advanced regression and ensemble modeling skills, gained experience in linking data science with business KPIs, and enhanced Power BI storytelling for executive dashboards.
